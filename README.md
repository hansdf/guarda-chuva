# Should you bring an umbrella to go out today?

This is my first time working with a proper Go application.
it should be a minimalist CLI tool that displays if you should bring an umbrella to go out(as in, it will rain that day)

It consumes a REST API from openweathermap.org that provides 5 day forecast at any location on the globe.

For now, the coordinates(lat, lon) are fixed for Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul.

In the future I'd like to make a web app version of this with a frontend!
